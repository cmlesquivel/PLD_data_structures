### Objectives
1. What is a double linked list? --> votation 5
2. How to use double linked list? --> votation 4
3. Why to use it? --> votation 3
4. When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets --> votation 3
5. When to use sets versus lists --> votation 2

### Activities to accomplish Objectives
* we talked about de double linked list, we done exercices as such palindrome.
* We speak about python functions, structus, dictionaries, tuplas, sets and others
* WhitheBoard


### Bottlenecks

* list comprehension 
* functions set, map, lamda, reduce 

### Conclusions
* Double linked list help us save process, memory and make the code much faster
* It is advisable to know the functions that Python offers us to correctly handle the structures
