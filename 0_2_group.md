### Objectives
1. What do LIFO and FIFO mean --> votation 4
2. What is a double link list, how to use stack and queues in a double link list --> votation 3
3. What is a queue and stack, and when to use it --> votation 2
4. What is Monty language --> votation 3
5. What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues --> votation 4
6. What is the proper way to use global variables --> votation 4
7. what is a pointer function


### Activities to accomplish Objectives
* we talked about of stack and queues in a  double linked list.
* we explain a exercise recursion (stask application)
* we talked about stack and queues functions 
* we summarize the project Monty
* We spoked to use the global variables
* WhitheBoard


### Bottlenecks

* Stack 
* pointer functions
* extern global variables

### Conclusions
* Double linked list help us save process, memory and make the code much faster
* It is advisable to know the functions about stack and queues offers us to correctly handle the structures
* we used the global variables when we need to send a value in multiples files
